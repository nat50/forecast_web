# Dry Eye Disease

This dataset provides structured data from subjects aged **18 to 45** for predictive modeling and diagnostic analysis of **Dry Eye Disease (DED)**. It is meticulously designed to explore the complex, bidirectional relationship between modern lifestyle factors, sleep health, and Ocular Surface Diseases (OSD).

## 1. Data Explanation and Key Features

The dataset is built around two core analytical pillars: **Ocular Health Indicators** (the dependent variables) and **Lifestyle/Sleep Factors** (the independent variables/predictors).

### Core Data Attributes:

| Feature Category | Key Features | Analytical Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ocular Symptoms** | eye redness, itchiness, eye strain | Direct markers and subjective symptoms of DED. These form the primary output (DED severity score or binary classification). |
| **Digital Lifestyle** | screen time, blue-light filter usage | Quantifies modern risk factors, which are known to increase DED risk by reducing the blink rate and increasing tear evaporation. |
| **Sleep Health** | sleep quality, sleep duration | Crucial features for investigating the strong correlation between poor sleep (including potential insomnia) and DED, which is often a reciprocal relationship. |
| **Demographics** | age (18-45) | Allows models to adjust for age-related baseline differences within the working-age adult population. |
